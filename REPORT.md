# Final Report: Deployment and Web Application Analysis


## Details of Deployment and URL where application can be accessed:

The deployment of the URL of our web application was accomplished through the Cloudflare service provider. The following steps, underscore the methodology used to deploy our web application:

1. Firstly, we created logged into the Cloudflare dashboard by creating an account on Cloudflare Pages.
2. Secondly, from the sidebar we selected "Workers & Pages", then selected the "Build an application" tab and then clicked on the "Pages" tab.
3. Within the Pages tab, we selected the choice to "connect to Git":

5. Upon selecting the "Connect to Github" notice, we were given the option to select in which organisation we would prefer to install Cloudflare and we selected the organisation of "MQCOMP2110-2024":

6. Next, we were asked to select from the available repositories and we selected our private group repository of "MQCOMP2110-2024/web-development-project-group-100":

#### Why Widget was chosen?

The widget I chose for the task manager application was the game widget. Specifically, I created a Tic Tac Toe game widget.  I chose the game widget due it's high complexity as I wanted to challenge myself with the logic and general thinking involved within game development. I also wanted to delve more thoroughly into the whole process of game design (through the use of css) which was intricate as with designing a game - the most diminutive details - such as the game button do need to be designed in harmony with the rest of the game user interface, to create an appealing game interface. 

#### Most challenging aspect of the project?

Since Tic Tac Toe has multiple combinations that could result in both the X and O players in winning, tying or losing, the most challenging aspect of the project was creating an array for all the possible combinations for the game outcomes (win, tie, lose). The process was profoundly tedious as I had to identify and consider all available win conditions within the standard Tic Tac Toe 3x3 grid and subsequently, create an array that controls all the "win" combinations present within the game. I had to approach the multi-dimensional array as a means of representing the user interface of the Tic Tac Toe game box. I had to map and categorise the win conditions and represent them using the array indices. The challenging aspect was not merely the creation of the array, but also the fact that I had to state the array indices that would potentially generate a horizontal win, vertical win or diagonal win in the board. The horizontal wins were consituted by the following indices: [0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]. The vertical wins were generated by the following index combinations:  [0, 3, 6], [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8]. Lastly, the diagonal wins were generated by these combinations: [0, 4, 8], [2, 4, 6]. Another intricate aspect of the game board was correlating the array indices to the cells of the game board. The array index numbers represented a game board cell that ranged from 0 to 8 as there are nine cells, from left to right and top to bottom. My final array with the combinations for gaining a victory in the game was successfully crafted as showcased below:

 const victoryRequirements = [
    [0, 1, 2],
    [3, 4, 5],
    [6, 7, 8],
    [0, 3, 6],
    [1, 4, 7],
    [2, 5, 8],
    [0, 4, 8],
    [2, 4, 6]
